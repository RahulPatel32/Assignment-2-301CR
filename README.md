Rahul, Monika, Chase

This repository contains the joint University Assigment work of Rahul Patel, Monika Ivanova and Chase Parsons.

The Assignment required the creation and implementation of a Multiplayer Game, its Multiplayer Server component 
as well as a leader board for storing things such as player scores and profile names etc.

In order to run the programs...
Download the game then go to Assignment-2-301CR-master\Assignment-2-301CR-master\Tic Tac Toe\Project4\Debug, and run the executable file. 
If that doesn't work open the Visual studio solution file named Project4.sln . When you run the project the game should start.

Extract Rahul Leaderboard test.zip then open Rahul Leaderboard test.flv to watch a video of the leaderboard being tested
